# LSOD
(1)Our code and dataset will be made public in this project after the paper is accepted.  
(2)We have uploaded some example samples from the dataset in this project.  
(3)These are sonar images obtained by scanning at different distances underwater using forward looking sonar. The distances are 3m, 4m, 5m, 7m, 10m, 15m, 30m, and 40m, respectively.It can be learnt from the target change that when the scanning distance is farther away, the target's imaging target on the sonar image is smaller. Therefore, in real underwater scenarios, long-range search faces a serious small target problem.
